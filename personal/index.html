                <h1>Programmer and developer.</h1>
                <p class="first-p">I am 40 years old and have a degree in Computer Science. I have little experience in the area, but I love studying and learning new things.My first job in the area was at a public transport company, where programming projects were developed using languages ​​such as JavaScript and TypeScript. Also worked with ReactJS. He also worked at the company JupiterOne - USA, where I had the opportunity to learn and apply Front-End solutions. I have some projects as a web programming student, such as a simple sales website or also control of activities to be carried out. I like to be challenged and I try to fulfill my work obligations in the best way possible. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has helped me through a solid foundation in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Through the teachings that Christ left us, we can learn ethical principles that we can carry throughout our lives and also apply them in our professional lives.</p>
                <p class="second-p">I'm here to help companies through my knowledge in web programming with different roles, responsibilities and objectives towards a common goal: finishing a project together.</p>
                <p class="third-p">I was enchanted by the area of ​​web programming, I had the opportunity to participate in some projects in the area. I was a web programmer for a company owned by my city council called Superintendency of Traffic and Public Transport where for a year and two months I applied my knowledge using the JavaScript language. After that time I was hired by a company in Utah called JupiterOne where I learned a lot about teamwork.</p>
                <p class="third-p">During my time at the junior company and in projects, I acquired knowledge about people management, communication, use of project and people management programs. Therefore, I believe I have a lot to contribute as a web developer. I have knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript languages. I've done small projects with Java and PHP.</p>
