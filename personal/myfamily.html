                <p>Well, being born to good parents, I was raised in a conservative family. My parents gave me a good education, an education that I try to pass on to my daughter.</p>

                <p>I was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the age of 22 and less than a year after baptism I decided to serve a full-time mission.</p>

                <p>When I arrived from my mission, I chose my wife to be my eternal companion. We got married in May 2014. After 4 months of marriage, my wife became pregnant with my beloved daughter.</p>

                <p>This is my beloved daughter, Millie Abis. She is a smart and very studious girl. She likes reading good books and says all the time that she will be a scientist.</p>

            <div class="fpart-4">
                <img src="images/temple-family.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Today she is 8 years old and was baptized. She continues studying and learning the straight ways of the Lord. I learned on my mission the importance of being a father, perhaps God wants to teach us exactly that, to be parents, as He is a Father.</p>
