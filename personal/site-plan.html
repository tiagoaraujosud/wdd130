     <h1>My Mission Time</h1>
     
     <p>
      During 2 years I served as a volunteer in São Paulo, where I participated in weekly service projects for the local community and taught Christian principles through street contacts, door to door and social media. I had responsibilities for groups of volunteers at the local and regional levels. As the leader of the group, I was in charge of the work and results of 36 volunteers. Organized and directed weekly training and coordination meetings. Through this experience, I developed training and organization skills. I learned how to manage time and relationships effectively. I also learned to set goals and define short, medium and long term steps to achieve them.
     </p>
     <p>
      During  9 months, I took care of sensitive documents and financial statements for a local church unit. I also generated reports and statistics and participated in board meetings and periodic financial audits. Thanks to this experience, I strengthened my organizational skills and developed skills in planning and financial statements. As financial secretary, I managed and work with values ranging from 3 to 5 thousand Reais a week. Among other activities, I was responsible for the monthly payment of rent for about 80 houses as well as for the maintenance and contracts of the same and new rented houses. Also having experience in the fortnightly payment of allowance for about 180 employees. During this period I had the opportunity to work with the head of research at Microsoft. Participating in meetings where the language was only English.

     <h1>My Family</h1>
     <p>
      Well, being born to good parents, I was raised in a conservative family. My parents gave me a good education, an education that I try to pass on to my daughter.
     </p>
     <p>
      I was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the age of 22 and less than a year after baptism I decided to serve a full-time mission.
     </p>
     <p>
      When I arrived from my mission, I chose my wife to be my eternal companion. We got married in May 2014. After 4 months of marriage, my wife became pregnant with my beloved daughter.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is my beloved daughter, Millie Abis.
      She is a smart and very studious girl. She likes reading good books and says all the time that she will be a scientist. 
     </p>
     <p>
      Today she is 8 years old and was baptized. She continues studying and learning the straight ways of the Lord.
      I learned on my mission the importance of being a father, perhaps God wants to teach us exactly that, to be parents, as He is a Father.
